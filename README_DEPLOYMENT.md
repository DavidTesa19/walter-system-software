## 🏁 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Railway Setup (15 min)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project from your repository
4. Add PostgreSQL database

### Step 2: Migrate Data (10 min)
```powershell
cd server
# Edit .env with your Railway DATABASE_URL
node migrate-to-postgres.js
```

### Step 3: Deploy (20 min)
Configure services in Railway:
- Backend: `server` folder, start with `node server-postgres.js`
- Frontend: `client` folder, standard Vite build
- Set environment variables as documented

**Total time: ~45 minutes to production!**

---

## 📖 How to Use This Package

### For Initial Deployment
1. **Read**: `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (5 min)
2. **Follow**: Each checkbox step-by-step
3. **Reference**: `RAILWAY_SETUP.md` for details
4. **Understand**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` for context

### For Daily Development
1. **Use**: `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for commands
2. **Sync data**: Run `sync-from-railway.ps1` when needed
3. **Deploy**: Just `git push` - Railway auto-deploys

### When Something Goes Wrong
1. **Check**: Troubleshooting section in `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
2. **Review**: Railway logs in dashboard
3. **Verify**: Environment variables are set correctly

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### Two Modes of Operation

#### Development Mode (Local)
```powershell
cd server
npm run dev  # Uses db.json file
```
- Data stored in `db.json`
- Fast iteration
- Safe testing
- No internet required

#### Production Mode (Railway)
```powershell
# Automatic on Railway
NODE_ENV=production node server-postgres.js
```
- Data in PostgreSQL database
- Multiple users
- Persistent storage
- Professional hosting

### The Smart Switching System

The server automatically detects which mode to use:
- **If `DATABASE_URL` exists** → Use PostgreSQL
- **If `DATABASE_URL` is empty** → Use JSON file

This means:
- ✅ Local dev works as before
- ✅ Production uses real database
- ✅ No code changes needed between environments
- ✅ Safe separation of test and production data

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Work Process

```
1. Make changes locally
   └─► Edit code in VS Code

2. Test locally
   └─► server: npm run dev (uses db.json)
   └─► client: npm run dev

3. Everything works?
   └─► git add .
   └─► git commit -m "Description"
   └─► git push origin main

4. Railway auto-deploys
   └─► Wait ~2 minutes
   └─► Check production URL
   └─► Verify changes work

5. Client uses updated app
   └─► No downtime
   └─► Data preserved
   └─► New features available
```

### Testing with Production Data

```powershell
# Download production data to test locally
.\sync-from-railway.ps1

# Now your local db.json has real production data
# Test locally without affecting production

# Changes to local db.json DON'T go to production
# Only code changes (via git push) go to production
```

## 🛡️ Data Safety

### Your Data is Protected By:

1. **PostgreSQL ACID Compliance**
   - Atomic transactions
   - Consistent state
   - Isolated operations
   - Durable storage

2. **Railway Infrastructure**
   - Automatic backups
   - Redundant storage
   - 99.9% uptime SLA
   - Enterprise security

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Local test data ≠ Production data
   - Development ≠ Production environment
   - Manual migration only when you want

4. **No Accidental Overwrites**
   - Deploying code doesn't touch database
   - Only explicit migrations move data
   - Sync only goes production → local (one way)

---
