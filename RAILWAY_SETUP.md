## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Railway account with paid subscription ($5/month)  
‚úÖ GitHub account with walter-system-software repository  
‚úÖ Local development environment working

---

## Railway Setup

### Step 1: Create New Project

1. Go to **https://railway.app/dashboard**
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose **`walter-system-software`** repository
5. Click **"Deploy Now"**

### Step 2: Configure Project

Railway will create a service for your repository. We'll configure it properly next.

---

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"** ‚Üí **"Add PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway will provision a PostgreSQL database (takes ~30 seconds)
4. You'll see a new **"Postgres"** service in your project

### Step 2: Get Database Connection String

1. Click on the **"Postgres"** service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Copy the **`DATABASE_URL`** value (starts with `postgresql://`)
4. **Save this for later** - you'll need it for migration

**Example:**
```
postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-123.railway.app:5432/railway
```

---

## Backend Deployment

### Step 1: Configure Backend Service

1. Click on your **main service** (should show your repo name)
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Service Name"** and rename to: `walter-system-backend`
4. Click **"Root Directory"** and set to: `server`
5. In **"Start Command"**, set to: `node server-postgres.js`

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

1. Go to **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"+ New Variable"** and add:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3004
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
```

3. Railway automatically adds `DATABASE_URL` (links to your Postgres service)

### Step 3: Connect Database to Backend

1. In **"Variables"** tab, check if `DATABASE_URL` exists
2. If not, click **"+ New Variable"**
3. Select **"Add Reference"** ‚Üí Choose your Postgres service ‚Üí `DATABASE_URL`

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Railway needs to know to install `pg` package:

1. In your project, I've already prepared everything
2. Railway will automatically run `npm install` in the `server` directory
3. The deployment will start automatically

---

## Frontend Deployment

### Option A: Deploy Frontend on Railway (Recommended)

1. In Railway project, click **"+ New"** ‚Üí **"GitHub Repo"**
2. Select **same repository** (`walter-system-software`)
3. Configure the new service:
   - **Service Name**: `walter-system-frontend`
   - **Root Directory**: `client`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npx vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

4. Add environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
   ```

5. Get your backend URL:
   - Click on `walter-system-backend` service
   - Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Networking"**
   - Copy the **public URL** (e.g., `https://walter-system-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

6. Update `VITE_API_URL` with your actual backend URL

### Option B: Deploy Frontend on Vercel (Alternative)

If you prefer Vercel for frontend:

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Set **Root Directory**: `client`
4. Add environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
   ```
5. Deploy

## Data Migration

Now that your database is set up, let's migrate your local data to Railway PostgreSQL.

### Step 1: Set Up Local Environment

1. In your local project, copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```powershell
   cd server
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file and add your Railway database URL:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@...railway.app:5432/railway
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

### Step 2: Install PostgreSQL Driver

```powershell
cd server
npm install pg
```

### Step 3: Run Migration Script

This will copy all data from `db.json` to Railway PostgreSQL:

```powershell
node migrate-to-postgres.js
```

You should see:
```
üöÄ Starting migration from JSON to PostgreSQL...
‚úì Loaded JSON data from: db.json
‚úì Database tables initialized

üì¶ Migrating partners...
  ‚úì 4 records migrated successfully
üì¶ Migrating clients...
  ‚úì 3 records migrated successfully
üì¶ Migrating tipers...
  ‚úì 3 records migrated successfully

üéâ Migration complete!
üìä Total records migrated: 10
```

### Step 4: Verify Data in Railway

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on **"Postgres"** service
3. Go to **"Data"** tab
4. You should see your tables with data

---

## Testing & Verification

### Test Backend API

1. Get your backend URL from Railway (e.g., `https://walter-system-backend-production.up.railway.app`)
2. Test health check:
   ```
   https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health
   ```
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "ok": true,
     "database": "postgresql",
     "environment": "production"
   }
   ```

3. Test data endpoints:
   ```
   https://your-backend-url.railway.app/partners
   https://your-backend-url.railway.app/clients
   https://your-backend-url.railway.app/tipers
   ```

### Test Frontend

1. Open your frontend URL
2. Try to login
3. Navigate to different grids (Partners, Clients, Tipers)
4. Try CRUD operations:
   - ‚úÖ Create a new record
   - ‚úÖ Edit existing record
   - ‚úÖ Delete a record
5. Check that changes persist after refresh

---

## Development Workflow

### Local Development (Using JSON Files)

When developing locally, your server uses `db.json`:

```powershell
# In server directory
npm run dev
```

- Changes go to local `db.json`
- Does NOT affect production database
- Perfect for testing new features

### Sync Production Data to Local

Want to test with real production data locally?

```powershell
# In server directory
# First, set RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL in .env
node sync-from-production.js
```

This downloads production data to your local `db.json`:
- ‚úÖ Safe - only downloads FROM production
- ‚úÖ Never uploads local changes TO production
- ‚úÖ Great for debugging with real data

### Deploy Updates

1. Make changes locally
2. Test with local JSON database
3. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Railway **automatically deploys** your changes
5. Database data is **preserved** (not reset)

---

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Persistence

- **Production database is permanent** - data survives deployments
- **Local db.json is for testing** - separate from production
- **Never commit sensitive data** to Git

### üîí Security

- Never commit `.env` file to Git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- Keep database credentials secure
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### üí∞ Costs

- **Railway**: $5/month (includes hosting + PostgreSQL)
- **Data storage**: Included in Railway plan
- **Bandwidth**: Generous free tier, then pay-as-you-go

### üìä Monitoring

Railway provides:
- **Logs**: Real-time server logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Alerts**: Email notifications for issues

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

1. Check **Logs** in Railway dashboard
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set
3. Verify `server/server-postgres.js` exists
4. Check that `pg` package is installed

### Frontend can't connect to backend

1. Check `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
2. Verify backend URL is correct and accessible
3. Check CORS settings in backend
4. Open browser console for error messages

### Database connection errors

1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. Check if Postgres service is running
3. Restart backend service in Railway
4. Check Railway service logs

### Migration script fails

1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in `.env`
2. Check that `db.json` exists and is valid JSON
3. Check Railway Postgres service is running
4. Look at error message for specific table/field issues

## Next Steps

‚úÖ Railway account created and paid  
‚úÖ PostgreSQL database provisioned  
‚úÖ Backend deployed and running  
‚úÖ Frontend deployed and connected  
‚úÖ Data migrated to PostgreSQL  
‚úÖ Production app accessible to client  

**Your app is now production-ready! üéâ**

Your client can use it, and all data is safely stored in Railway's PostgreSQL database. Every time you push code to GitHub, Railway automatically deploys updates without touching the database.
